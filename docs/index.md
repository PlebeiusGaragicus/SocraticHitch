# Socratic Hitch

> `Hitch` (verb) to move (something) into a different position with a jerk

This project is meant to help users collect their thoughts into cogent "Socratic" arguments in an effort to enable their arguments to be as rich and hard-hitting as those of the beloved Christopher Hitchens.


We propose a web application called "Socratic Hitch" that can be analogzed to a "bicycle for the mind" when it comes to the task of argumentation and chain-of-thought.

## What is a "Socratic Seminar"

[argument.py](./argument.md) gives a 'pseudo-code' like format to a "Socratic Seminar" in which an argument is structred into one or more of several clauses, each of which holds its own definitions by providing evidence, and each of which may be refuted.  This can create an "arguments all the way down" tree of argumentation and refutation which provides a clear structure of **evidence-based reasoning.**

This tool being a `hitch` which can pull you along, deeper into the act of research and self-argumentation in order to develop and refine your beliefs.

These "Seminars" are meant to be shared with others, refuted, refined, shared, researched and interrogated... endlessly... as we slowly build out clear-headed thinking which may help us live more informed lives.
